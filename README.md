---------------

### How the Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. There are eight pairs of cards in the deck, each pair has a unique symbol. At the start of the game, the cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol facedown. 
The score panel tracks the elapsed time, number of attempts at making a match, and displays 1-3 stars based on the cumulative number of attempts (fewer attempts equal more stars).

#### How to Win
Successfully match all 8 pairs of cards.

#### How to Play
* Click on a card and it will flip-over to reveal its symbol
* Click on a second card in an attempt to make a match with the first card
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped-over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to facedown position
* Continue clicking on cards until all pairs are matched
